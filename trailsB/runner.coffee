          Trail Making Task
          ==========================

          In this task you will make a "trail" connecting circles in a particular order.

          You will see a number circles appear on the screen. Each circle will have a number (1,2,3 ...) or a letter inside.

          Your goal is to make a trail linking all the numbered circles and lettered circles alternating in order between numbers and letters.

          Thus, you will first look for the circle with "1" inside, click it, and then find "A" and click that.

          Next you will click 2 and then "B", and so on until you have connected all the circles.

          To make a path between two circles, simply click the next circle in the path.

          When you select the correct circle, it will turn yellow. When you complete the trail, the final circle will turn red.
